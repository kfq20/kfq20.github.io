<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University, advised by Prof. Song-Chun Zhu. My research explores multi-agent decision making, empathetic cooperation, and social intelligence. I am also a research intern in the Multi-Agent System Lab at the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI), where I build learning algorithms for mixed-motive environments. Previously, I completed my B.S. in Automation at Tsinghua University (GPA 3.78/4.00).

**Research interests:** multi-agent reinforcement learning, social intelligence, large language model agents
